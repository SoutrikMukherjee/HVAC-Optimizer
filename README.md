# HVAC-Optimizer

A **Machine Learning-Based HVAC Optimization System** designed to enhance energy efficiency in commercial buildings.  
This system uses historical sensor data and a trained Random Forest model to predict energy consumption and dynamically optimize HVAC settings (temperature & fan speed) in real time.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Train a model** using past HVAC sensor data.
2. **Generate valid combinations** of temperature setpoints and fan speeds.
3. **Predict energy consumption** for all combinations using the trained model.
4. **Select the best setting** based on minimum predicted energy usage within comfort constraints.
5. **Visualize** the energy landscape using a heatmap.

## ðŸ“Š Visualization Output

After successful optimization, the following heatmap is generated to illustrate predicted energy consumption across various settings:

ðŸŸ¦ **Blue** = lower energy usage (good)  
ðŸŸ¥ **Red** = higher energy usage (bad)  
ðŸ’¡ The optimizer **automatically selects** the best zone (lowest energy in comfort range)

# HVAC-Optimizer

A **Machine Learning-Based HVAC Optimization System** designed to enhance energy efficiency in commercial buildings. This system uses historical sensor data and a trained Random Forest model to predict energy consumption and dynamically optimize HVAC settings (temperature & fan speed) in real time.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Training:**  
   Historical sensor data (outside/inside temperature, humidity, timestamps) is preprocessed and used to train a RandomForestRegressor model.

2. **Optimization:**  
   Given the current building conditions and comfort constraints (e.g., minimum and maximum allowed temperatures), the system:
   - Generates a grid of possible HVAC settings (temperature setpoints and fan speeds).
   - Predicts the energy consumption for each setting.
   - Selects the optimal settings that minimize predicted energy usage while satisfying comfort constraints.

3. **Visualization:**  
   A heatmap is generated to display the predicted energy consumption across the range of settings.  
   - **Blue** regions indicate lower energy consumption (optimal),
   - **Red** regions indicate higher energy consumption.

## ðŸ“Š Visualization Output

After optimization, the script automatically saves a heatmap at `images/hvac_optimization_heatmap.png` that illustrates the energy landscape:

## âœ… Example Output

When you run the script, youâ€™ll see console output similar to this:

```bash

# HVAC-Optimizer

A **Machine Learning-Based HVAC Optimization System** designed to enhance energy efficiency in commercial buildings.  
This system uses historical sensor data and a trained Random Forest model to predict energy consumption and dynamically optimize HVAC settings (temperature & fan speed) in real time.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Train a model** using past HVAC sensor data.
2. **Generate valid combinations** of temperature setpoints and fan speeds.
3. **Predict energy consumption** for all combinations using the model.
4. **Select the best setting** based on minimum predicted energy usage within comfort constraints.
5. **Visualize** the energy landscape using a heatmap.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Output

After successful optimization, the following heatmap is generated to illustrate predicted energy consumption across various settings:

> ðŸ”µ Blue = lower energy usage (good)  
> ðŸ”´ Red = higher energy usage (bad)  
> The optimizer automatically selects the best zone (lowest energy in comfort range)

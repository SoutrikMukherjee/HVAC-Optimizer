# HVAC-Optimizer
Machine Learning-Based HVAC Optimization System for Energy Efficiency in Commercial Buildings
This project focuses on designing a machine learning-based system to optimize HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) operations in commercial buildings. By using predictive modeling and real-time optimization, the system aims to minimize energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. 
It integrates thermodynamic principles with advanced data analysis to provide practical solutions for energy-efficient building management. The project also highlights its alignment with sustainability goals and industry standards such as ASHRAE 55.
